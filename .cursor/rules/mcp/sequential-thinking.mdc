## Context

The **sequential-thinking** MCP produces a structured operational plan (numbered steps, assumptions, risks, success criteria) from a goal.
This plan MUST be generated and consulted **before any action**.

## Mandatory Rules

1. **Pre-action requirement**
   Before **any** action (tool call, command execution, code change, web browse, file write, API request), call the `sequential-thinking` MCP with:

   - the current goal,
   - active context/rules,
   - current work state (open files, relevant diffs),
   - known constraints (time, tokens, costs, safety).

2. **Expected MCP output**
   The MCP must return at least:

   - **Plan**: 3–7 numbered steps, each with _goal_, _inputs_, _expected output_.
   - **Assumptions / Unknowns**.
   - **Risks** + mitigations.
   - **Success criteria** for the **next step** (measurable).
   - **Decision point** (when to re-plan).

3. **Stepwise execution**

   - Execute **only step 1** of the plan.
   - After execution, **validate** against the success criteria; if not met → **re-call** `sequential-thinking` to adjust the plan.
   - Move to the next step only when criteria are met.

4. **Minimal traceability**
   - Before each action, keep (internall
